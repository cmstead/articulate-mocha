# Articulate Mocha #
## Test Like You Talk ##

Articulate Mocha is the best way to create tests with Mocha and test like you talk. More often than not, we talk in symbols and "wait, no that other thing." The goal, instead, is to make it easier to think less about the code you have to write and more about the test logic you care about.

Articulate Mocha supports both the BDD and TDD APIs for the Mocha test framework. Start typing and get the best snippet experience you can get for Mocha test authoring.

Articulate Mocha is an accompanying extension to Articulate JS:
